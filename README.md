# ChromeCustomTabsExample

There are different ways of presenting web based content in Android app.

Some can be based on handling everything within custom `WebView`.


But as majority of Android phones have Chrome browser by default, we can benefit from this and use [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) based on [support library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/packages.html#custom-tabs)

Current project contains small demo of how to use Custom Tabs.
